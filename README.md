## Summary

With a strong background in Marketing and Graphic Design, backed by over 13 years of experience in the industry, I transitioned to Web Development at the prestigious coding bootcamp, Makers Academy, located in London. This transformative experience has shaped me into a passionate Web and Mobile Developer, eager to tackle technological challenges head-on.

In my role as a Junior Software Developer, I bring a diverse skill set that I honed during my intensive training. I possess expertise in Python, Flask, JavaScript, Jest, Node.js, Express and React for web applications, Swift and SwiftUI for iOS mobile app development, proficiently work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Figma, and have expertise in SQL, Postgres, TablePlus, MongoDB, MongoDB Compass, Mongoose, Git, and GitHub, in addition to TDD, pair programming, and agile methodologies.

I dedicated time to self-directed study before commencing my Makers bootcamp journey attending the iOS and Swift Bootcamp by Udemy and watching classes of CS50 by Harvard.

I am dedicated to becoming a versatile developer, merging my previous experience with my newfound programming skills. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to create innovative solutions, contribute to meaningful projects with inspiring companies, and continue my journey of learning and growth in the web development arena.
